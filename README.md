# Hyperplane2MV
Extracting Lukasiewicz logical formulae from functions using the method [Aguzzoli, 1998]

The McNaughton theorem states that: 
1) every truth function in Lukasiewicz logic is a continuous piecewise linear 
function with integer coefficients; 
2) conversely, every such function can be expressed by a logical formula. 

The Hyperplane method proposed in [Aguzzoli, 1998] is a constructive proof of 2) in McNaughton theorem. 
We provide an implementation of this method in Python.
